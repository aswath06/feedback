    <strong>Dear Butterfly,</strong>
    <p>
        I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks for your incredible teaching. 
        Your guidance through both the basics and advanced concepts of Java has made a huge difference 
        in my understanding and confidence. The way you explain complex topics with such clarity and 
        patience is truly inspiring. I feel more capable and motivated to continue learning because of you.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for being such a wonderful mentor. ðŸŒ¸ 
    </p>
